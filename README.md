The chipKIT Fubarino SD board brings affordable, breadboard compatible high speed computing power to the Arduino-compatible chipKIT/MPIDE platform. It is able to run almost all Arduino sketches right out of the box at a great price, and includes more memory, speed, and I/O pins than a typical Arduino or clone. And it includes a microSD card slot for easy sketch access to huge file storage.

Class on a stick. Course materials can fit on the SD card. The device mounts as a USB device. Unfortunately, at 1.0 speeds. But 
it will cut 45 minutes of getting started to 15 minutes. When offering online course using electronics all the course materials can be placed on the board.



The goal with the project is two have two boards that are excellent for small, and bread boardable projects.
