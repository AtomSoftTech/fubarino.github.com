Fubarino Mini v1.0 board - changes for v1.1 : 04/04/2012* For v1.1, move 32KHz crystal so it lies flat. Rotate 90 degrees to right. (done)* Add some silk screen on some pins so you know where to start counting. (done)* Calculate correct crystal cap values and update BOM (done)* Make 32KHz crystal a do not populate on schematic and in BOM (done)* Move PRG and RESET switches further apart (done)Fubarino Mini v1.1 board - changes for v1.2 : 06/08/2012* Add in two diodes to allow USB or external VIN power* Separate out 5V_OUT and VIN as separate pins* Swap GND and 5V_OUT/VIN so 5V_OUT/VIN are on endFubarino Mini v1.2 board - changes for v1.3 : 07/17/2012* Extended pads for CPU by .3mm so you can rework the part (at request of SeeedStudio)* Switched power LED to RED in BOMFubarino Mini v1.3 board - changes for v1.4 : 07/18/2012* Switched CPU footprint to QFN44, routing updates to support this change* C13 switched to 10uF for better 3.3V stabilityFubarino Mini v1.5 board - changes to v1.4 : 02/23/2012 (for Microchip)* Added chipKIT to silk screen* Added RoSH garbage icon to silk screen* Added CE icon to silk screen* Updated to different USB connector (Hirose UX60-MB-5ST) and re-routed USB signals to fitFubarino Mini v1.6 board - changes to v1.5 : 03/14/2012* J2 pin 17 is now RESET rather than GND. This allows external RESET connection without needing to use J3* Changed BOM to use 820 ohm LED current limiting resistors rather than 330sFubarino Mini v1.7 (now v2.0) board - changes to v1.6 : 08/13/2015* Connected VBUS net to VBUS PIC32 pin rather than 5V to prevent over voltage on Vin from damaging PIC32 VBUS pin.* Changed D1 and D2 to CUS15S40,H3F types to handle 1.5A max current* Changed IC1 to AP7215-33YG-13 to handle 600mA of current (rather than 250mA from old part). Note that max Vin is now 5.5V. (see below)* Change CPU to PIC32MX270F256D-I/ML. Same as before but with twice the Flash and RAM  August 2018 update, to create final v1.7 (v2.0) design, based on emails with Matt Jenkins:  * Change regulator to SPX1117M3-L-3-3/TR (requires layout change)  * Change USB connector to micro-USB  * LEDs get 820 ohm resistors  Fubarino Mini v2.0 - 10 built up on 8/24/2018. All work as expected.
