FUBARStep v1.0

First board soldered up on 4/1/2013 at Schmalz Haus.

Problems to fix for v1.1:

* 100uF caps are too wide. Either find skinnier caps, or move footprints around for more space
* 3-pin power header is really hard to get to. Could there be a better place? Or more room?
* Need to use 5-pin screw terminals for motors so we can accomodate uni-polar motors
* Make sure to check voltage regulator part number for vertial, not horizontal, part
* Give power jack a touch more room - it's squashed agsint header
* Re-order motor outputs so that motor 1 is at top and motor 4 is at bottom
* Fix silk screen label for center pin on top I/O row - should be +3V3 not +5V
