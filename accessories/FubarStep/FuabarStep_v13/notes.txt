FUBARStep v1.0

First board soldered up on 4/1/2013 at Schmalz Haus.

Problems to fix for v1.1:

* 100uF caps are too wide. Either find skinnier caps, or move footprints around for more space
* 3-pin power header is really hard to get to. Could there be a better place? Or more room?
* Need to use 5-pin screw terminals for motors so we can accommodate uni-polar motors
* Make sure to check voltage regulator part number for vertical, not horizontal, part
* Give power jack a touch more room - it's squashed against header
* Re-order motor outputs so that motor 1 is at top and motor 4 is at bottom
* Fix silk screen label for center pin on top I/O row - should be +3V3 not +5V

Problems to fix for v1.2:

* FTDI TX and RX are backwards (Make sure to check with SD and Mini to be sure)

Problems to fix for v1.3:

* Silk screen is too thin for Seeed's process : make bigger/thicker
* Swap placement for power selector header and 5V regulator - in v1.2, regulator may interfere with USB connector
* Copy silk screen for motor outputs to bottom of board
* Add pull-down resistors to all 4 enable lines
* Add pull-down resistors to all 8 motor control lines
* Change text of PWRSEL to REG/UNREG or something similar - 5V/6-12V is too confusing
* Separate 3-pin servo headers so that you can stack them full of servos
* Move PWRSEL to right in front of USB connection
* Move voltage regulator away from USB connection a bit.
* Make silk text thicker
* Update BOM so it's accurate
