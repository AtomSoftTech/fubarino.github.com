Version 1.0, problems:

* Silk screen messed up - acidentally turned on the part names on the silk layer
    Fix: turn them off before next build
* Swapped PGC and PGD on ICSP connector
    Fix: swap them back for v1.1
* No LED orentation markers on silk screen
    Fix: add them to v1.1
* Crystal is really, really big
    Fix: Find smaller one for v1.1
* For 3.3V regulator, change to one with fixed voltage (3.3V), and smaller if possible
* 250mA poly fuse is too small
    Fix: Switch to 500mA polyfuse for v1.1
* VUSB needs to be tied to +3.3V
* Update MX440 symbol to have all pin functions listed
* MCLR should not have a pin number - can't use it as an I/O pin
* Should we have a pin 0? (rather than starting at 1)

Version 1.1, problems:

* Forgot to remove the PTC - should be removed for v1.2
* Possible change - make all silk screen pin names read same way?
* Silk screen next to green LED is wrong. It should read 21.
* Reverse green LED so it goes to GND rather than 3.3V.
