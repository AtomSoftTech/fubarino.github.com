Power Fubarino from USB

Unzip Fubarino.zip into variants folder

I have a ICD3 (at the top of the picture) with my custom made RJ-11 to 6-pin .100" header. On that cable (from the ReadlIce) (from left to right)

Direct Connect

ICD3 : value
Blue: unused
Yellow: PGC
Green: PGD
Red: GND
Black: 3.3V
White: MCLR/RESET



Bread Board Example


R:B: value
Blue: White : unused
Yellow: Black : PGC
Green: Red : PGD
Red: Green : GND
Black: Yellow : 3.3V
White: Blue : MCLR/RESET

Then I have five jumpers that connect that ICD3 cable to the Fubarino, again, from left to right

ICD3 : Color : Fubarino
PGC :: Red : A9
PGD :: Yellow : A8
GND :: Green : GND
3.3V :: Black : 3.3
MCLR/RESET : : RST

The important thing is that the cable from the ICD3 goes into the Fubarino 1:1 except for PGC and PGD which need to be reversed.

Hopefully this will help you when you start to program yours on Friday.
