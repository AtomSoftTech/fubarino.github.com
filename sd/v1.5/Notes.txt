Version 1.0, problems:

* Silk screen messed up - acidentally turned on the part names on the silk layer
    Fix: turn them off before next build
* Swapped PGC and PGD on ICSP connector
    Fix: swap them back for v1.1
* No LED orentation markers on silk screen
    Fix: add them to v1.1
* Crystal is really, really big
    Fix: Find smaller one for v1.1
* For 3.3V regulator, change to one with fixed voltage (3.3V), and smaller if possible
* 250mA poly fuse is too small
    Fix: Switch to 500mA polyfuse for v1.1
* VUSB needs to be tied to +3.3V
* Update MX440 symbol to have all pin functions listed
* MCLR should not have a pin number - can't use it as an I/O pin
* Should we have a pin 0? (rather than starting at 1)

Version 1.1 problems - fix for v1.2:

* Forgot to remove the PTC - should be removed for v1.2 (done)
* Possible change - make all silk screen pin names read same way? (done)
* Silk screen next to green LED is wrong. It should read 21. (done)
* Reverse green LED so it goes to GND rather than 3.3V. (done)
* Check cap values for both crystals (done)
* Move reset and program switches further apart (done)

Version 1.2 - changes for v1.3:

* Add two diodes to allow power from USB or VIN input pin
* Separate out 5V in from post-diode power net, bring to pins
* Swap GND and 5V_OUT/VIN so 5V_OUT/VIN are on end

Version 1.3 - changes for v1.4:

* C13 changed from 1uF to 10uF, and from 0603 ro 0805, to help reduce VCC drop on microSD insert

Version 1.4 - changes for v1.5 (for Microchip):

* Added chipKIT, CE mark, and RoHS mark to bottom silk screen and chipKIT to top silk screen
* added RX silk to pin 8 and TX silk to pin 9
* changed USB connector to Microchip's preferred Hirose UX60-MB-5ST
